      <description>A random variable is perhaps the most fundamental concept in probability. However, during the intro course I never thought about the motivation behind this concept and just accepted it blindly. It was only until I took measure-theoretic probability that I realized a lack of intuition of this concept hindered my ability to consolidate abstractness into understanding. Therefore, I&amp;rsquo;m sharing my understanding here with you, and perhaps you will find it helpful.</description>
