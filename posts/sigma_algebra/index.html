Without proper motivation, it can be quite perplexing why we even need this concept in the first place. After all, we managed to do all sorts of cool stuff in an intro course without it! Hopefully by the end of this post, you will not only understand why it’s so central to study probability but also make sense why we define it the way it is.\n$\\quad$Let’s pretend we are some mathematicians living in an alternate universe knowing nothing about $\\sigma$-algebra and we want to study experiments with random outcomes. All we know is that given an experiment with sample space $\\Omega$ and any event $A \\subseteq \\Omega$ from this sample space, we want the probability measure to satisfy the three probability axioms from an intro course:\n$\\quad$(i) $0\\leq P(A) \\leq 1$.\n$\\quad$(ii) $P(\\emptyset) = 0, P(\\Omega) = 1$.\n$\\quad$(iii) If $A_1, A_2, \\ldots$ are disjoint events, then $$ P \\left(\\bigcup_{n=1}^{\\infty} A_n \\right) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}P(A_n) $$ (countable additivity).\nA countable example $\\quad$With this knowledge in mind, we want to start with some concrete examples and study them systematically so that we can generalize our results. Sadly the alternate universe is not void of the clichés from this world, so first inevitably we are going to consider an experiment where we toss a coin twice. Since we are mathematicians and not physicists, we are not actually going to perform the experiment. Instead we notice that once we setup the rules of the experiment, although the outcome is still random, all the possible outcomes are deterministically known: they are ${HH},{HT},{TH},{TT}$, and together via set union they form the sample space $\\Omega =\\{ {HH} \\cup {HT}\\cup {TH}\\cup {TT} \\}$. In other words, $\\Omega$ already contains considerable information about the experiment.\nWe can further exploit this information by considering all possible ways to group the outcomes. For example, we can group ${HH},{HT}$ together via set union to represent the event where the first toss lands on a head. Each grouping is an event and is clearly a subset of $\\Omega$. Then all possible events forms a collection of all subsets of $\\Omega$, which looks like $$ \\{\\emptyset,{HH},{HT},{TH},{TT},{HH} \\cup {HT}, \\ldots, {HT} \\cup {TH} \\cup {TT}, \\Omega \\} $$\n$\\quad$As you may know, this is the power set of $\\Omega$, denoted $2^{\\Omega}$. We can interpret $\\emptyset$ as “impossible events”, such as the event that the coin lands on a torso in the first toss (what?). Now with this collection of events, we can compute the corresponding probability for each event the “intro way” and obtain a deterministic map between the events and their probabilities, giving us a probability measure $P$ defined on all events. Therefore, the triple $(\\Omega,2^{\\Omega},P)$ gives us everything we know or care about the experiment before executing it. In other words, we have the complete information about this experiment prior to execution. How neat!\nAn uncountable example $\\quad$Clearly one example cannot give us sufficient understanding, so let’s consider a harder problem. Consider a 1D dart-throwing experiment, where the landing position of the dart is equally likely to be found at any real number along the interval $[0,1]$ (that is, the position follows a uniform distribution on $[0,1]$ but I don’t want to go into random variable or distribution now.). Clearly, the sample space $\\Omega = [0,1]$. Notice that this interval contains uncountably many elements, as opposed to only 4 elements in the coin toss example. Just like the last example, we still want to find the collection of all possible events by grouping the elements of the sample space. We might naturally suspect that this collection is again the power set of $\\Omega$. But we are a bit cautious, as flashbacks from analysis remind us uncountable sets can get weird very quickly. So the question is: what could go wrong with the power set of an uncountable set?\n$\\quad$It turns out that there exist some abominations in this power set! They are much more elusive than the typical subsets we can construct directly from elements in $\\Omega$. In fact, it requires us to invoke the notorious Axiom of Choice in order to construct disjoint subsets of $[0,1]$ (called the Vitali sets) for each rational number in $[0,1]$ and together they form an even partition of $[0,1]$. If we assign probability measure to these sets using the common notion of “length” (Lebesgue measure), due to the even partition they must have the same measure $P(H)$. Countable additivity eventually leads to the result that $$ 1=P([0,1]) = \\sum_{q \\in \\mathbb{Q} \\cap [0,1]} P(H), $$ which contradicts the fact that countable sum of the same quantity can only equal 0 or diverge but never to 1. Don’t worry if you didn’t understand the sketch of this contradiction (see Rosenthal 1.2 for details), the important takeaway is that **we cannot assign probability measure to these subsets of the power set, or they would break the axioms of probability that we treasure dearly!** There are two ways to reconcile this problem: we can either tweak the axioms of probability or Axiom of Choice to get rid of the contradiction somehow, or we can banish these abominations from our analysis. Luckily, this is quite an easy choice: since the abominations require a convoluted construction using Axiom of Choice, they are unintelligible in the real world sense and do not represent any meaningful events. We can safely ignore them without losing any information of the events we care about.\nA bottom-up approach $\\quad$Phew, crisis averted! However, we soon realize that it is no easy feat to exclude these abominations from the power set. Although the Axiom of Choice sheds light on their existence, it offers no insight on how to describe them explicitly. Without even knowing what they look like, we also wouldn’t know what the complement of their union looks like, nor can we assign probability measure to unknown sets. Hence, it seems that the top-down approach of excluding them from the power set is a dead end. How about if we approach from bottom-up? If we can construct a collection, namely $\\mathcal{F}$, that includes all possible events but not the abominations, then we achieve the same objective. Since it’s easier for us to think of an explicit event than a non-event on $[0,1]$, this approach seems to be much more promising.\n$\\quad$Next we immediately face two questions. First, how should we define the rules of construction (aka the definition)? Second, can $\\mathcal{F}$ be described explicitly via some elementary “building blocks” so defining a probability measure on these simple events is enough to give us a well-defined probability measure on all events?\nThe construction rules $\\quad$To make the rules for constructing the collection $\\mathcal{F}$, we need to keep in mind that the purpose of $\\mathcal{F}$ to help us assign probability measures to events. Therefore, we want to see that $\\mathcal{F}$ contains all the sets described in the axioms of probability, which tell us what types of subsets of $\\Omega$ we care about for probability. Thus, we can take an axiomatic approach and restrict $\\mathcal{F}$ to satisfy properties we want it to have. The first rule makes sure we include the events $\\emptyset$ and $\\Omega$ in the collection $\\mathcal{F}$:\n$\\quad$(i) $\\emptyset \\in \\mathcal{F}$ or $\\Omega \\in \\mathcal{F}$.\n$\\quad$We only need one of the two as we anticipate that the second rule will immediately give us the other. Since probability measure has the property that $P(A^c) = 1 - P(A)$ for any event $A \\subseteq \\Omega$, we enforce a second rule to ensure the complement of any event is an event and resides in our collection $\\mathcal{F}$:\n$\\quad$(ii) If $A \\in \\mathcal{F}$, then $A^c \\in \\mathcal{F}$.\n$\\quad$The last axiom of probability demands countable unions, so let’s make sure $\\mathcal{F}$ is closed under countable unions as well so we can assign probability measure to these events. This allows us to rigorously study infinite coin toss and many more exotic events!\n$\\quad$(iii) If $A_1, A_2,\\ldots \\in \\mathcal{F}$, then $\\bigcup_{n=1}^{\\infty} A_n \\in \\mathcal{F}$.\n$\\quad$Note that we do not require $(A_n)$ to be disjoint here, although disjointness can be easily achieved using (ii). These three axioms largely parallel those of probability, and the differences are just a matter of preference, since we can choose a different set of axioms to derive the current axioms and vice versa.\nLo and behold, if $\\mathcal{F}$ is a collection of subsets of $\\Omega$ that satisfies these three axioms, then we define $\\mathcal{F}$ to be a $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$-algbera on $\\Omega$! This shows that the concept of $\\sigma$-algbera naturally arises from the need of finding a collection of subsets of $\\Omega$ that encompasses all events but excludes abominations, so we can safely assign probability measure to every set in this collection without break the axioms of probability. Notice that in our previous coin toss example, or in fact any experiment with countable/finite sample space $\\Omega$, the $\\sigma$-algebra is precisely $2^{\\Omega}$.\nThe building blocks $\\quad$It remains to find the “building blocks” of $\\mathcal{F}$. It is not hard to see that subsets such as $[a,b], (a,b), (a,b], [a,b)$ where $0\\leq a Let’s recap $\\quad$When studying a random process, we are interested in knowing the probability of some events occurring. Thus, it would be important to know what the possible events are. In an intro course, we vaguely define these events to be subsets of the sample space $\\Omega$ without worrying about the things that could go wrong in those subsets. In a more rigorous setting, we see that the power set of $\\Omega$ gives us the information we desire when $\\Omega$ is finite or countably infinite but contains pathological subsets that break axioms of probability for uncountable $\\Omega$. For the latter case, we require a new concept that allow us to define probability measure on all its elements, including all possible events that we care about. Therefore, $\\sigma$-algebra is essential for building a rigorous probability theory.\n",

<p>$\quad$Typically one of the first concepts introduced in a measure-theoretic probability course is $\boldsymbol{\sigma}$<strong>-algbera</strong> (or equivalently $\sigma$-field). Without proper motivation, it can be quite perplexing why we even need this concept in the first place. After all, we managed to do all sorts of cool stuff in an intro course without it! Hopefully by the end of this post, you will not only understand why it&rsquo;s so central to study probability but also make sense why we define it the way it is.</p>
<p>$\quad$Let&rsquo;s pretend we are some mathematicians living in an alternate universe knowing nothing about $\sigma$-algebra and we want to study experiments with random outcomes. All we know is that given an experiment with sample space $\Omega$ and any event $A \subseteq \Omega$ from this sample space, we want the probability measure to satisfy the three probability axioms from an intro course:</p>

<p>$\quad$(ii) $P(\emptyset) = 0, P(\Omega) = 1$.</p>
<p>$\quad$(iii) If $A_1, A_2, \ldots$ are disjoint events, then
$$
P \left(\bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} A_n \right) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}P(A_n)
$$ (countable additivity).</p>
<h2 id="a-countable-example">A countable example<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#a-countable-example">#</a></h2>

For example, we can group ${HH},{HT}$ together via set union to represent the event where the first toss lands on a head. Each grouping is an event and is clearly a subset of $\Omega$. Then all possible events forms a collection of all subsets of $\Omega$, which looks like

Since probability measure has the property that $P(A^c) = 1 - P(A)$ for any event $A \subseteq \Omega$, we enforce a second rule to ensure the complement of any event is an event and resides in our collection $\mathcal{F}$:</p>
<p>$\quad$(ii) If $A \in \mathcal{F}$, then $A^c \in \mathcal{F}$.</p>
<p>$\quad$The last axiom of probability demands countable unions, so let&rsquo;s make sure $\mathcal{F}$ is closed under countable unions as well so we can assign probability measure to these events. This allows us to rigorously study infinite coin toss and many more exotic events!</p>
<p>$\quad$(iii) If $A_1, A_2,\ldots \in \mathcal{F}$, then $\bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} A_n \in \mathcal{F}$.</p>
<p>$\quad$Note that we do not require $(A_n)$ to be disjoint here, although disjointness can be easily achieved using (ii). These three axioms largely parallel those of probability, and the differences are just a matter of preference, since we can choose a different set of axioms to derive the current axioms and vice versa.</p>
<p>Lo and behold, if $\mathcal{F}$ is a collection of subsets of $\Omega$ that satisfies these three axioms, then we define $\mathcal{F}$ to be a $\boldsymbol{\sigma}$<strong>-algbera</strong> on $\Omega$! <strong>This shows that the concept of $\sigma$-algbera naturally arises from the need of finding a collection of subsets of $\Omega$ that encompasses all events but excludes abominations, so we can safely assign probability measure to every set in this collection without break the axioms of probability.</strong> Notice that in our previous coin toss example, or in fact any experiment with countable/finite sample space $\Omega$, the $\sigma$-algebra is precisely $2^{\Omega}$.</p>
<h3 id="the-building-blocks">The building blocks<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-building-blocks">#</a></h3>
<p>$\quad$It remains to find the &ldquo;building blocks&rdquo; of $\mathcal{F}$. It is not hard to see that subsets such as $[a,b], (a,b), (a,b], [a,b)$ where $0\leq a &lt; b \leq 1$ are all simple interval forms representing the events of the dart landing inside the interval. Moreover, each interval form can give rise to all other interval forms (including singletons $\{a\}$) via set operations. Intuitively, we might think that perhaps any set in $\mathcal{F}$ can be constructed from these interval forms. This is unfortunately not the case. Indeed, we can find a counterexample that shatters our hope to construct all elements of the $\sigma$-algebra $\mathcal{F}$ explicitly. How can we assign well-defined probability measure to them if we don&rsquo;t know what they are! Imagine how frustrated we would feel if we didn&rsquo;t know any better, as the bottom-up approach seems to meet a dead end as well. Luckily, the Extension Theorem will magically help us achieve exactly what we want without the need to explicitly describe all elements of $\mathcal{F}$. But we shall defer the discussion of the counterexample and the extension of measure as they deserve their own post.</p>
<h2 id="lets-recap">Let&rsquo;s recap<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#lets-recap">#</a></h2>
<p>$\quad$When studying a random process, we are interested in knowing the probability of some events occurring. Thus, it would be important to know what the possible events are. In an intro course, we vaguely define these events to be subsets of the sample space $\Omega$ without worrying about the things that could go wrong in those subsets. In a more rigorous setting, we see that the power set of $\Omega$ gives us the information we desire when $\Omega$ is finite or countably infinite but contains pathological subsets that break axioms of probability for uncountable $\Omega$. For the latter case, we require a new concept  that allow us to define probability measure on all its elements, including all possible events that we care about. Therefore, $\sigma$-algebra is essential for building a rigorous probability theory.</p>
