Since the proof of this claim is rather involved and doesn’t aid our intuition, I shall simply refer you to the last subsection in Chapter 1.2 of Billingsley for details. The takeaway is that our inability to construct all elements of $\\mathcal{F}$ using intervals poses a serious challenge to measuring them.\nAn algebra $\\quad$Before we go any further, let’s introduce some concepts first. We want to consider the question: if $\\sigma$-algebra is too hard to measure directly, what’s the next best thing that is easy to measure? We already discussed that intervals are easy, but so are their complements and finite unions. If I give you a subset of $[0,1]$ that is constructed by complements and finite unions of intervals, you can pretty much eyeball the total length yourself by just adding the length of each segment together. Therefore, it would be useful to define a collection of subsets of $\\Omega$ that is closed under complements and finite unions instead of countable unions:\n$\\quad \\mathrm{Definition}$: Suppose $\\Omega$ is a non-empty set and $\\mathcal{F}_0$ is a collection of subsets of $\\Omega$. $\\mathcal{F}_0$ is called an algebra (or a field) if\n$\\quad$(i) $\\emptyset \\in \\mathcal{F}_0$ or $\\Omega \\in \\mathcal{F}_0$.\n$\\quad$(ii) If $A \\in \\mathcal{F}_0$, then $A^c \\in \\mathcal{F}_0$.\n$\\quad$(iii) If $ A_1, A_2,\\ldots, A_n \\in \\mathcal{F}_0 $, then $$ \\bigcup_{i=1}^{n} A_i \\in \\mathcal{F}_0.$$\n$\\quad$Notice that the only difference between an algebra and a $\\sigma$-algebra is closure under finite versus countable union in the third axiom. This seemingly small difference is enough to get rid of all the hard-to-measure sets.\n$\\quad$Now if $\\Omega = [0,1]$, then the algebra of interest would be $$\\mathcal{F}_0=\\{\\text{finite unions of all intervals in }[0,1]\\}.$$ It follows that “length” is a well-defined probability measure for all of the elements in $\\mathcal{F}_0$. We are done measuring $\\mathcal{F}_0$!\n$\\quad$Next, let’s specify which $\\sigma$-algebra we care to assign measure to. You may be wondering how $\\sigma$-algebra is not unique for a sample space $\\Omega$? This is because due to its constructive nature, we can always add more subsets into the collection and make a bigger $\\sigma$-algebra. For example, if the only subset in the collection is $\\Omega$ itself, then the $\\sigma$-algebra generated by $\\{\\Omega\\}$ is just $\\{\\emptyset,\\Omega\\}$. But if I add more subsets to the collection, we will generate a bigger $\\sigma$-algebra. Since an algebra $\\mathcal{F}_0$ is much easier to measure, the $\\sigma$-algebra we care about is the $\\sigma$-algebra generated by $\\mathcal{F}_0$, denoted $\\sigma(\\mathcal{F}_0)$. It is also the smallest $\\sigma$-algebra containing $\\mathcal{F}_0$. (An analogy in group theory is that the cyclic group generated by $a$, $\\langle a \\rangle$, is the smallest cyclic group containing $a$.)\nExtension Theorem $\\quad$You might start to see where we are going with this. Our goal can now be formally stated:\n$\\quad \\mathrm{Carathéodory’s\\ Extension\\ Theorem\\ (for\\ probability)}$: A probability measure on an algebra $\\mathcal{F}_0$ has a unique extension to the generated $\\sigma$-algebra $\\mathcal{F} := \\sigma(\\mathcal{F}_0)$.\n$\\quad$The key insight is that although elements in $\\mathcal{F}$ can be weird, they are really not that far off from the elements in $\\mathcal{F}_0$. They might look different, but they can share the same measure when they are close enough that their difference is measure-zero.\n$\\quad$What does it mean by “close enough”? This motivates us to define the following concepts:\n$\\quad \\mathrm{Definition}$: The outer measure is defined as `$$P^*(A) = \\inf\\left\\{\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} P(A_n): A_n \\in \\mathcal{F}_0, A \\subset \\bigcup_{n=1}^{\\infty} A_n \\right\\}.$$\n$\\quad$ The inner measure is defined as `$$P_*(A) = 1-P^*(A^c).$$\n$\\quad$Intuitively, given an element $A$ of $\\mathcal{F}$, outer measure let us assign $A$ the measure of the “smallest” covering of $A$ using countable elements from $\\mathcal{F}_0$. The covering that yields the infimum is what we consider “close enough”. Similarly, inner measure gives us the measure of the “largest” filling of $A$ using sets from $\\mathcal{F}0$. Outer measure approaches $A$ from the outside and inner measure approaches from the inside. If we want a well-defined measure for $A$, perhaps we want to see that its outer measure agrees with its inner measure. That is, $P^*(A) = P(A) = P(A)$. This may remind you of the idea of squeeze theorem or the definition of limit of a sequence via $\\limsup$ and $\\liminf$. We can rewrite this expression just in terms of the outer measure: $$P^(A) + P^*(A^c)=1$$\n$\\quad$This is a requirement we would like to start with. However, despite the suggestive name, we have not shown that the outer measure is a valid probability measure on $\\mathcal{F}$. Proving this requires a lot of heavylifting that is not suitable for a post about intuition. Instead, I would like to address one unintuitive thing I found about the proof:\nThe mysterious $\\mathcal{M}$ $\\quad$Recall that for this proof we usually define a mysterious set $\\mathcal{M}$ as the following:\n$$\\mathcal{M} = \\{A \\subseteq \\Omega: P^*(A \\cap E) + P^*(A^c \\cap E) = P^*(E)\\ \\forall \\ E \\subseteq \\Omega\\}$$\n$\\quad$This set turns out to be $P^*$-measurable and central for the proof, but what is the intuition behind defining this set?\n$\\quad$This is in fact a common trick in measure-theoretic probability proofs. If we want a $\\sigma$-algebra generated by a collection of subsets $\\mathcal{A}$ to have a certain property, we define another collection of subsets $\\mathcal{M}$ that possesses such property and show that $\\mathcal{M}$ is also a $\\sigma$-algebra containing $\\mathcal{A}$. Since $\\sigma(\\mathcal{A})$ is the smallest such $\\sigma$-algebra, it follows that $\\sigma(\\mathcal{A}) \\subseteq \\mathcal{M}$, which proves that $\\sigma(\\mathcal{A})$ also possesses the property.\n$\\quad$Here, the property we want is $P^*(A)+P^*(A^c) = 1$ for all $A \\in \\mathcal{F}$, which would get us very close to proving that $P^*$ is a valid probability measure. The $\\mathcal{M}$ we define is actually equivalent to the collection of sets that satisfy this property (see Billingsley Problem 3.2), and the reason we adopt the more complicated-looking definition with set $E$ is that it makes the proof easier.\nLet’s recap $\\quad$Defining a valid measure on $\\sigma$-algebra is too challenging, so we instead find the next-best thing – algebra $\\mathcal{F_0}$ and extend any measure defined there to the $\\sigma$-algebra generated by the algebra $\\mathcal{F}$. Since elements in $\\mathcal{F}$ might be somewhat inaccessible, we use the concepts of outer and inner measures to approach the proper measure. If elements in $\\mathcal{F}$ are measurable, then we expect their outer measure to agree the inner measure. This leads to the requirement $P^*(A)+P^*(A^c) = 1$. This is how we define $\\mathcal{M}$ expect that we use an equivalent expression. Eventually we can show that $\\mathcal{F} \\subset \\mathcal{M}$ and therefore $\\mathcal{F}$ is $P^*$-measurable.\n",

<p>$\quad$Recall that at the end of the <a href="https://www.jadenmath.com/posts/sigma_algebra/">$\sigma$-algebra post</a>, I briefly mentioned that we cannot just construct all elements of $\sigma$-algebra $\mathcal{F}$ on $\Omega$ using intervals and set operations.

<p>$\quad$(i) $\emptyset \in \mathcal{F}_0$ or $\Omega \in \mathcal{F}_0$.</p>
<p>$\quad$(ii) If $A \in \mathcal{F}_0$, then $A^c \in \mathcal{F}_0$.</p>
<p>$\quad$(iii) If $ A_1, A_2,\ldots, A_n \in \mathcal{F}_0 $, then $$ \bigcup_{i=1}^{n} A_i \in \mathcal{F}_0.$$</p>
<p>$\quad$Notice that the only difference between an algebra and a $\sigma$-algebra is closure under finite versus countable union in the third axiom. This seemingly small difference is enough to get rid of all the hard-to-measure sets.</p>

We are done measuring $\mathcal{F}_0$!</p>

This is because due to its constructive nature, we can always add more subsets into the collection and make a bigger $\sigma$-algebra.

<p>$\quad$What does it mean by &ldquo;close enough&rdquo;? This motivates us to define the following concepts:</p>
<p>$\quad \mathrm{Definition}$: The <strong>outer measure</strong> is defined as
`<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
$$P^*(A) = \inf\left\{\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} P(A_n): A_n \in \mathcal{F}_0, A \subset \bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} A_n \right\}.$$</p>
